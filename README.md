Checkbook_balancing_OOP_C++
Built an object-oriented C++ program to manage checkbook balances, using custom Money and Check classes with operator overloading for financial operations.
- Designed dynamic input handling to track cashed and uncashed checks, calculate updated balances, and flag invalid entries.
- Applied arrays of objects, constructors, getters/setters, and friend functions to organize user data and perform aggregate financial        computations.
